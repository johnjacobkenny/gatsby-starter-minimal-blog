I am a software engineer by profession. I am passionate about computers and technology and love learning new things all the time.

I love music, and it has been a big part of my life. I was a member of my church choir since 2005 and I also played the church organ since 2014 when I was in college. You can see music videos on my youtube channel.

I am an introvert, but I love people. I love to teach and mentor others. I want to leave the world a little happier everyday. ðŸ˜Š
